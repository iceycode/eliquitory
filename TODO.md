##TODO##

Testing

* test on virtual android device


GradleConnectionError Issue

* this may have to do with old classes being sought
* or maybe the JDK is simply not set correctly
* test in eclipse, to rule out if IntelliJ 14.0.2 issue
* last resort - remake the dam project (even this does not seem to work!!!)

Market Services - deployment

- add google ads, google play services
- add a larger database into the mix (possibly in future release)

SupplyScreen

* regular supplies checkboxes not checked when opening edit window
* make the window more opaque, it is now too transparent
* make the messageFontColor not as light
* create separate textFont style for editing supply window
* for some reason, only with supplies, title tab bar is not up at top

SupplyScreen & CalculatorScreen

* when going from Calcscreen to SupplyScreen, nicotine base supply is set to settings in calcscreen
~~set a custom textfieldfilter.~~ <---should be strikethrough
